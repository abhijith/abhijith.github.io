Dear XYZ,

    I would like to apply for the role of "Software Engineer, Cloud". I heard about Zenuity from a friend and the role looks well aligned with my background. I have also heard pleasant things about the Swedish work culture and would relish the experience.

    During the last 11 years, I have had the opportunity to work on cloud computing, container technologies, distributed systems, file systems, solve problems using machine learning and develop applications in a variety of programming languages. I have also mentored junior engineers, gathered business requirements, formalized business processes, introduced good engineering practices, planned and executed projects under tight deadlines.

    Primarly, my experience has been in systems and infrastructure engineering. I have experience building data pipelines (good understanding of Lambda and Kappa architecture), have deployed, tuned and programmed against distributed systems like Hadoop and ZooKeeper, and have modelled data in NoSQL systems.

    I am very interested in programming language design and in-line with this interest have tried to learn languages with different paradigms. I am particularly fond of functional programming languages and have played around with Common lisp, Haskell, written applications in Clojure and built a VM scheduler using Erlang.

    Working with different systems and roles has helped me appreciate the intricacies involved in any design process. I think it has made me a better engineer. Most importantly, it has helped me to better empathize with people in different roles.

    I am generally a curious person and like stepping out of my comfort zone and pushing boundaries. This has helped me grow and has helped me shape my learning, my thought process and my career.

    I look forward to your response and hope to explore the possibility of working with your team.


    Sincerely,
    Abhijith
