Dear XYZ,

    I would like to apply to the role of BLAH advertised at BLAH.com

    I have 10 years of experience as a Software Engineer in multiple
    domains. Having predominantly worked in startups and as such have
    donned multiple roles ranging from developer, individual
    contributor, devops and software architect in the most recent
    years.

    During these 10 years, I have had the opportunity to work on cloud
    computing, virtualization technologies, distributed systems, file
    systems, solve problems using machine learning techniques and
    develop applications in a variety of programming languages.

    I have also mentored junior engineers, gathered business
    requirements, formalized business processes, introduced good
    engineering practices, planned and executed projects under
    tight deadlines.

    These varied experiences have equipped me to appreciate the
    inherent trade-offs and nuances involved in the software design
    process at all levels.

    I am generally a curious person and like stepping out of my
    comfort zone and pushing boundaries. This has helped me grow and
    has helped me shape my learning, my thought process and my career.

    I believe I can add value to your organization with my diverse
    experience. For further details regarding my experience please
    refer to my enclosed resume.

    I thank you for your consideration and look forward to hear from you.


    Regards
    Abhijith
