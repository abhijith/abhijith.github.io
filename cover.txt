<p>Hello,</p>

		<p> I would like to apply for the role of "Software Engineer, Cloud". I heard about Zenuity from a friend and the role looks well aligned with my background.

		<p>    Over the course of the last 11 years I have worked predominantly for startups and as such have donned multiple roles: developer, individual contributor, infrastructure engineer, data engineer. I have also had the good fortune of working in diverse areas like cloud computing, micro services, distributed systems, Linux Kernel and machine learning. Primarly, my experience has been in cloud and infrastructure engineering; have built data pipelines, deployed, tuned and programmed against distributed systems like Hadoop and ZooKeeper, modelled data in NoSQL systems.

<p>Outside the professional setting, I frequently read and think about a variety of topics (including but not limited to philosophy, psychology, astrophysics). I am generally a curious person and like to understand how the world works.</p>




<p>I thank you for your time and look forward to have an interesting and open discussion.</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>

<p>Abhi</p>
