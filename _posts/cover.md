Hi!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to apply to role of Senior
Software Engineer at Booking.com. Following is a summary of
professional background and my interests.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last 12 years I have had the opportunity to work on a diverse
set of things. Some of things that I have worked on include cloud
computing, container technologies, distributed systems, file systems,
solve problems using machine learning and develop applications in a
variety of programming languages.
   I have also mentored junior engineers, gathered business requirements,
formalized business processes, introduced good engineering practices,
planned and executed projects under tight deadlines.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Primarly, my experience and interest is in systems and infrastructure
engineering. I have built data pipelines (have a good understanding of
Lambda and Kappa architecture), have deployed, tuned and programmed
against distributed systems like Hadoop and ZooKeeper, and have
modelled data against NoSQL and SQL systems.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Working with different systems and roles has helped me appreciate the
intricacies involved in any design process. I think it has made me a
better engineer. Equally importantly, it has helped me to better
empathize with people in different roles.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the technical stuff, I am generally a curious person and like
stepping out of my comfort zone and pushing boundaries. This has
helped me grow and has helped me shape my learning, my thought process
and my career.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank you for your time and I look forward to have an open discussion regarding the role and my background.


Regards

Abhi
