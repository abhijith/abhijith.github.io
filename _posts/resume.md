### Professional Summary  (2006 - present)

#### BlipBuilder Pvt Ltd (Principal Engineer, Feb 2019 - present)
*Technologies:* Rust, Python, PyO3, Golang, GRPC, AWS, Kubernetes, Kafka, RabbitMQ, WeaveWorks Flux, Redis.

* Planned and executed migration of over 70 services spread across multiple AWS regions to a new AWS account under extremely tight schedule.

* Consolidated different workflows and workloads under a single orchestrator: k8s.

* Re-architected systems to be consistent and with fewer moving parts.

* Reverse engineered, redesigned and re-implemented Blippar's image detection algorithm in Rust. Made several improvements to the system:
  moved from batch index to real-time index in terms of features and maintainability.

* Designed and implemented metering backend for Blippar's WebAR SDK client toolkit.

Drastically simplified systems and engineering workflows. Consequently reduced the AWS cost by ~90%.


#### Blippar India Pvt Ltd (Infrastructure Engineer, Apr 2017 - Oct 2018)
*Technologies:* AWS, Terraform, Consul, Nomad, Vault, Rancher, Drone, Helm, Kafka.

Actively worked towards an unified architecture to improve engineering effectiveness:

 * Containerized applications and worked with devs to ensure 12-factor conformance for existing containers.

 * Consolidated monitoring, alerting and metrics collection systems using Grafana and Prometheus.

 * Instituted Infrastructure-As-Code using Terraform and WeaveWorks Flux.

All-in-all reduced the complexity, human errors and AWS expenditure over 15%.

#### Styletag.com (Technical Architect, Nov 2014 - Nov 2016)
*Technologies:* Rails, Ruby, Chef, Chef-Provisioning, Sensu, AWS ecosystem, Vagrant, Resque.

*Styletag 2.0:* Designed a micro-services based e-commerce platform and replaced the SpreeCommerce based system.

  * Identified areas lacking formal business processes and helped formulate better workflows.

  * Designed and developed several components: Catalog management system, Promotion engine, Cart functionality, Refund/Return system, Scenario generation framework for testing.

  * Mentored junior engineers, introduced sound engineering practices; code reviews, automated testing, standardization of development environments and Infrastructure-As-Code.

The new system reduced infrastructure cost by 20-30% and increased the overall reliability of the system.

#### McKinsey & Company (McKinsey Digital Consultant, Apr 2013 - Aug 2014)
*Technologies:* AWS, Ruby, Cloudera Impala, OpenRefine, CsvDedupe, Hadoop Streaming, HBase.

* *Merger & Acquisition Analysis:* Applied machine learning for finding customer overlap between two clients. This data was in turn used for gathering KPIs for the M&A.

* *Airline Revenue Management application (Internal and Market performance analysis)*: Gathered business requirements, formulated formal models and architected the application backend. Also developed Data Simulation module for generating data for demos and testing.

* *Promotional analysis for the retail practice:* Re-architected the existing RDBMs based system using Hadoop/HBase and reduced turnaround time from ~60 hours to 10 minutes.

#### Higher Order Systems (Runa Inc) (Senior Software Engineer [Platform], Sep 2011 - Mar 2013)

*Technologies:* Ruby, Clojure, Vagrant, Chef, Ironfan, Hadoop, HBase, ZooKeeper, AWS, Sensu, RabbitMQ.

* Ported the Clojure application stack to Leiningen and standardized the development environment.

* Deployed and managed Hadoop, ZooKeeper and HBase cluster on AWS using Ironfan.

* Actively eliminated manual steps (and consequently human errors) via complete automation of deployments and configuration.

* Helped build AWS EMR-like functionality using custom AMIs and AWS Spot-Instances to spin-up Hadoop clusters in a matter of few minutes.

Reduced cloud expenditure by 45-50%, reduced human errors and increased reliability.

#### Atlantis Computing Pvt Ltd (Senior Developer, Apr 2007 - Aug 2011)

*Technologies:* C, Ruby, Python, Erlang, Mnesia, VMware, Device Mapper, Linux VFS.

*Atlantis ILIO: Full stack virtualization suite with in-line data deduplication*

  * Designed and developed core components for the data deduplication Linux Kernel module.

  * ILIO: Developed HTTP APIs and libraries for the ILIO VM Scheduler and storage layering component.

  * Was instrumental in re-architecting and prototyping the virtual machine scheduler using Erlang/OTP.

  * Designed and developed backend code and HTTP APIs for the administration console; policy engine for users / virtual assets, HTTP client for the load-balancer, VM health agents, etc.


#### DeepRoot Linux Pvt Ltd (Developer, Nov 2006 - Apr 2007)

* *LabourNet: Online portal to connect daily-wage workers to clients (Developed for Maya India)*

  Implemented the CRUD backend logic for the application using PERL and Catalyst framework.
